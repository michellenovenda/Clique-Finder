# Clique-Finder

In this project, you have two tasks to implement. Your program should take two input arguments. The first one is the file name of the input graph, and the second is an integer k.
1.	Core decomposition problem:
Given the input graph and an integer k, you need to find all vertices that have coreness equal or larger than k.
2.  Maximal clique problem:
Given the input graph, you need to output the largest clique you can find.
